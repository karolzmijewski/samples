## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  
The answer can be returned in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```
**Output:**
```
[0, 1]
```
**Explanation:**  
Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Example 2
**Input:**
```
nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2]
```

---

### Example 3
**Input:**
```
nums = [3, 3]
target = 6
```
**Output:**
```
[0, 1]
```

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.
