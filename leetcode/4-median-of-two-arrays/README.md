## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## Example 1

**Input:**

```
nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
```

**Output:**

```
2.00000
```

**Explanation:**
Merged array = \[1,2,3] and the median is 2.
